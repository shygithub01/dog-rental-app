# Booking & Communication System Enhancements

## Introduction

This specification outlines enhancements to the existing booking and communication system in the Dog Rental App. The current system already includes messaging, rental requests, and approval workflows through components like RentalRequestForm, RentalApprovalPanel, and basic notification systems. This spec focuses on adding calendar-based availability management, booking confirmation/cancellation improvements, real-time chat enhancements (typing indicators), message read receipts, and integration with the existing multi-image upload system and personality profiling features to the existing foundation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Calendar-Based Availability Management (New Feature)

**User Story:** As a dog owner, I want to manage my dog's availability using a calendar interface integrated with the existing rental request system, so that I can control when my dog is available for rent and prevent double bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a dog owner clicks on a date THEN the system SHALL allow them to toggle availability (available/unavailable/blocked)

4. WHEN a renter uses the existing RentalRequestForm THEN they SHALL see only available dates for booking
5. IF a dog has an active rental THEN those dates SHALL be automatically marked as unavailable in the calendar
6. WHEN availability changes are made THEN the existing rental request validation SHALL respect the calendar settings
7. WHEN a rental is approved through the existing RentalApprovalPanel THEN the calendar SHALL automatically block those dates
8. WHEN a dog owner sets recurring availability patterns THEN the system SHALL support weekly/monthly templates
9. WHEN viewing the calendar THEN owners SHALL see existing rental requests and approved bookings overlaid on the calendar

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Booking Confirmation and Cancellation System

**User Story:** As a renter, I want enhanced booking confirmation with cancellation options integrated into the existing rental system, so that I understand my rental commitment and have flexibility when plans change.

5. IF cancellation occurs more than 24 hours before start date THEN the system SHALL allow full cancellation with automatic refund processing
6. IF cancellation occurs within 24 hours THEN the system SHALL show cancellation policy and apply appropriate fees (50% refund)
7. WHEN a booking is cancelled THEN the system SHALL automatically free up the calendar dates and notify both parties through the existing notification system
8. WHEN booking status changes THEN the existing NotificationService SHALL send enhanced status updates with booking details
9. WHEN a booking expires without approval THEN the system SHALL automatically release the calendar dates and notify the renter
10. WHEN viewing booking details THEN users SHALL see dog photos from the existing PhotoCarousel component and personality traits
